## LLM - Detect AI-Generated Text

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly sophisticated, capable of generating text that is difficult to distinguish from human-written text. 

Our goal is to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately detect whether an essay was written by a student or an LLM. 

### Description
Can you help build a model to identify which essay was written by middle and high school students, and which was written using a large language model? With the spread of LLMs, many people fear they will replace or alter work that would usually be done by humans. Educators are especially concerned about their impact on studentsâ€™ skill development, though many remain optimistic that LLMs will ultimately be a useful tool to help students improve their writing skills.

At the forefront of academic concerns about LLMs is their potential to enable plagiarism. LLMs are trained on a massive dataset of text and code, which means that they are able to generate text that is very similar to human-written text. For example, students could use LLMs to generate essays that are not their own, missing crucial learning keystones. Your work on this competition can help identify telltale LLM artifacts and advance the state of the art in LLM text detection. By using texts of moderate length on a variety of subjects and multiple, unknown generative models, we aim to replicate typical detection scenarios and incentivize learning features that generalize across models.
